## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset tracked student achievement in Math and Portuguese for two Portuguese secondary schools. This dataset was created by collecting responses from school reports and a questionnaire. The data was collected by Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva in their 2008 study and adapted by Aman Chauhan. This dataset was created to try and predict the success of students based on different factors, as well as trying to understand keys to success and failure in eduaction. The data collected includes student's names, ages, addresses, as well as information about their schooling such as tutorage, study time, and educational assistance at home or at school. Other factors such as how leisure time was spent as well as alcohol consumption are also considered. Grades for each period of the school year, divided into thirds, are recordede to track students progress throughout the school year. This data was collected during the 2005 to 2006 school year across a period of 2 years from 2 different public schools: Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira.
